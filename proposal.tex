\instructions{This template is to be used in a single- stage submission
procedure or at the \nth{2} stage of a two-stage submission procedure.}

\instructions{The structure of this template must be followed when preparing
your proposal. It has been designed to ensure that the important aspects of your
planned work are presented in a way that will enable the experts to make an
effective assessment against the evaluation criteria. Sections 1, 2 and 3 each
correspond to an evaluation criterion.}

\instructions{Please be aware that proposals will be evaluated as they were
submitted, rather than on their potential if certain changes were to be made.
This means that only proposals that successfully address all the required
aspects will have a chance of being funded. There will be no possibility for
significant changes to content, budget and consortium composition during grant
preparation.}

\instructions{\textbf{Page limit:} \underline{The cover page and sections 1, 2
and 3, together should not be longer than 70 pages.} All tables, figures,
references and any other element pertaining to these sections must be included
as an integral part of these sections and are thus counted against this page
limit.}

\instructions{The page limit will be applied automatically; therefore you must
remove this instruction page before submitting.}

\instructions{If you attempt to upload a proposal longer than the specified
limit before the deadline, you will receive an automatic warning and will be
advised to shorten and re-upload the proposal. After the deadline, any excess
pages will be overprinted with a `watermark', indicating to evaluators that
these pages must be disregarded.}

\instructions{Please, do not consider the page limit as a target! It is in your
interest to keep your text as concise as possible, since experts rarely view
unnecessarily long proposals in a positive light.}

\instructions{The following formatting conditions apply.}

\instructions{The reference font for the body text of H2020 proposals is Times
New Roman (Windows platforms), Times/Times New Roman (Apple platforms) or Nimbus
Roman No. 9 L (Linux distributions).}

\instructions{The use of a different font for the body text is not advised and
is subject to the cumulative conditions that the font is legible and that its
use does not significantly shorten the representation of the proposal in number
of pages compared to using the reference font (for example with a view to bypass
the page limit).}

\instructions{The minimum font size allowed is 11 points. Standard character
spacing and a minimum of single line spacing is to be used.}

\instructions{Text elements other than the body text, such as headers, foot/end
notes, captions, formula's, may deviate, but must be legible.}

\instructions{The page size is A4, and all margins (top, bottom, left, right)
should be at least 15 mm (not including any footers or headers).}

\instructions{\color{red}\LARGE{It is \textbf{\emph{YOUR}}} duty to verify that
the output produced by this proposal outline conforms to the the EU proposal
requirements of your call! No guarantees are given.}
