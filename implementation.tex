\section{Work plan --- Work packages, deliverables}
\label{sec:work-plan}

\instructions{
Please provide the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item brief presentation of the overall structure of the work plan;
\item timing of the different Work Packages and their components (Gantt chart or
similar);
\item detailed work description, i.e.:
\begin{itemize}
\item a description of each Work Package (Table 3.1a);
\item a list of Work Packages (\autoref{tab:3.1b});
\item a list of major deliverables (\autoref{tab:3.1c});
\end{itemize}
\item graphical presentation of the components showing how they inter-relate
(Pert chart or similar).
\end{itemize}

\textit{Give full details. Base your account on the logical structure of the
project and the stages in which it is to be carried out. The number of work
packages should be proportionate to the scale and complexity of the project.}

\textit{ You should give enough detail in each Work Package to justify the
proposed resources to be allocated and also quantified information so that
progress can be monitored, including by the Commission}

\textit{ Resources assigned to Work Packages should be in line with their
objectives and deliverables. You are advised to include a distinct Work Package
on `management' (see section 3.2) and to give due visibility in the work plan to
`dissemination and exploitation' and `communication activities', either with
distinct tasks or distinct Work Packages.}

\textit{ You will be required to include an updated (or confirmed) `plan for the
dissemination and exploitation of results' in both the periodic and final
reports. (This does not apply to topics where a draft plan was not required.)
This should include a record of activities related to dissemination and
exploitation that have been undertaken and those still planned. A report of
completed and planned communication activities will also be required.}

\textit{If your project is taking part in the Pilot on Open Research Data, you
must include a  `data management plan' as a distinct deliverable within the
first 6 months of the project. A template for such a plan is given in the
guidelines on data management in the H2020 Online Manual.  This deliverable will
evolve during the lifetime of the project in order to present the status of the
project's reflections on data management.}

\textit{\textbf{Definitions:}}

\textit{\underline{``Work Package''} means a major sub-division of the proposed
project.}

\textit{\underline{``Deliverable''} means a distinct output of the project,
meaningful in terms of the project's overall objectives and constituted by a
report, a document, a technical diagram, a software etc.}}

\section{Management structure, milestones and procedures}
\label{sec:mgmt-struct}

\instructions{
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the organisational structure and the decision-making (including a
list of milestones (\autoref{tab:3.2a}))
\item Explain why the organisational structure and decision-making mechanisms
are appropriate to the complexity and scale of the project.
\item Describe, where relevant, how effective innovation management will be
addressed in the management structure and work plan.
\\
\\
\textit{Innovation management is a process which requires an understanding of both
market and technical problems, with a goal of successfully implementing
appropriate creative ideas. A new or improved product, service or process is its
typical output. It also allows a consortium to respond to an external or
internal opportunity.}
\item Describe any critical risks, relating to project implementation, that the
stated project's objectives may not be achieved. Detail any risk mitigation
measures. Please provide a table with critical risks identified and mitigating
actions (\autoref{tab:3.2b})
\\
\\
\textit{\textbf{Definitions:}}
\\
\\
\textit{\underline{`Milestones'} means control points in the project that help to
chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key
deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be
needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective
measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the
project where, for example, the consortium must decide which of several
technologies to adopt for further development.}

by a user group; field survey complete and data quality validated.}}

\instructions{
\textbf{Definition critical risk:}\\ \emph{A critical risk is a plausible event
or issue that could have a high adverse impact on the ability of the project to
achieve its objectives.}

\textbf{Level of likelihood to occur: Low/medium/high}\\ \emph{The likelihood is
the estimated probability that the risk will materialize even after taking
account of the mitigating measures put in place.}}

\section{Consortium as a whole}
\label{sec:consortium}

\instructions{
\textit{The individual members of the consortium are described in a separate
section 4. There is no need to repeat that information here.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the consortium. How will it match the project's objectives, and
bring together the necessary expertise? How do the members complement one
another (and cover the value chain, where appropriate),?
\item In what way does each of them contribute to the project? Show that each
has a valid role, and adequate resources in the project to fulfill that role.
\item If applicable, describe the industrial/commercial involvement in the
project to ensure exploitation of the results and explain why this is consistent
with and will help to achieve the specific measures which are proposed for
exploitation of the results of the project (see section 2.2).
\item \textbf{Other countries and international organizations:} If one or more
of the participants requesting EU funding is based in a country or is an
international organization that is not automatically eligible for such funding
(entities from Member States of the EU, from Associated Countries and from one
of the countries in the exhaustive list included in General Annex A of the work
programme are automatically eligible for EU funding), explain why the
participation of the entity in question is essential to carrying out the project
